# Module 6 Challenge

## Description
This challenge was designed in order to test our skills regarding the implementation of third-party API's within an application.  This was an especially challenging module for me.  This application utilizes the OpenWeather API in order to seaerch for a desired city's current weather as well as the projected forecast.

## Usage
To use the application, enter the city to be searched for in the search form that is displayed upon the initial page loading.  When the form is submitted, the current and forecasted weather is displayed on the page.  A search history is also displayed underneath the search form.

## Installation
No installation is necessary.  Applicatoin is ready to be used upon page loading.

## Tests
There are currently no tests being used on this application.
